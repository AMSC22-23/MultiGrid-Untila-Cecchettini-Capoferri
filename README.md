# Implementation of Multigrid method

## Method description
The Multigrid method is an iterative numerical technique used to solve discretized systems of equations, particularly those arising from partial differential equations (PDEs). It's a powerful method for accelerating the convergence of iterative solvers, especially for large-scale problems.
